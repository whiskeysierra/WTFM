this project is trying to accomplish and why it matters.
Describe the problem(s) this project solves.
Describe how this software can improve the lives of its audience.

- **Technology stack**: Indicate the technological nature of the software, including primary programming language(s) and whether the software is intended as standalone or as a module in a framework or other ecosystem.
- **Status**:  Alpha, Beta, 1.1, etc. It's OK to write a sentence, too. The goal is to let interested people know where this project is at. This is also a good place to link to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).
- **Links to production or demo instances**
- Describe what sets this apart from related-projects. Linking to another doc or page is OK if this can't be expressed in a sentence or two.

## Example

Your reader is seeing this first and it's your only chance to convince him/her to keep reading. The example should be minimalistic, preferably a one-liner, 5-10 lines tops. If there is a common *Hello World* example that comparable projects use to show their approach, this is the place.

```java
Magic magic = new Magic();
magic.applyTo(yourProject);
```
