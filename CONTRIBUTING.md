# Guidance on how to contribute

There are two primary ways to help:
 - Using the issue tracker, and
 - Changing the code-base.

## Using the issue tracker

Use the [issue tracker](../../issues) to suggest feature requests, report bugs, and ask questions. This is also a great way to connect with the developers of the project as well as others who are interested in this solution.

Use the issue tracker to find ways to contribute. Find a bug or a feature, mention in the issue that you will take on that effort, then follow the *Changing the code-base* guidance below.

## Changing the code-base

Generally speaking, you should fork this repository, make changes in your own fork, and then submit a [pull-request](../../pulls). All new code **must have associated unit tests** and **100% line and branch code coverage**.  Additionally, the code should follow any stylistic and architectural guidelines prescribed by the project. In the absence of such guidelines, **mimic the styles and patterns in the existing code-base**.
